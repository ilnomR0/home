    <p>we are currently working on a homepage that should really say who we are. Right now; this place is a mess. We are
      sorry for the inconvenience
    <p>
    <p>Here are some quick links with descriptions of all of our projects, and/or if the project you are looking for is
      in development, merely just a description</p>

      <h2><a href="https://bidder.paperproductions.org">Bidder</a></h2>
      <p> Bidder is a bidding application made for business cordinators for bidding applications. This app interfaces
        with google sheets, and goes through it mapping the bidding number with a name. Instead of calling out "number
        423? do we have a number 423?", you just say "jen? Do we have a jen baker?".</p>
      <br>

      <h2><a href="https://paperos.paperproductions.org">PaperOS (web version)</a></h2>
      <p> This is a web-based Oporating System. Initially started in 2022; this project has gone through multiple
        innovations as I have grown in my ability to program. This consists of a host of developer tools and
        applications for creating applications for whatever your needs may be. there are plans to blow this up into a
        fully-fledged Oporating System, when the language "paper" is completed.</p>

      <h2>Paper</h2>
      <p> Paper is a staticially typed, OOP oriented programming language with explicit control over memory, native
        compilation, and a rich standard library (POSH) for application-level development.
      <p> this is for developers who want a language with the ultimate flexibility between low-level and high-level. For
        beginners and professionals alike, for people who want the quickest development and the quickest execution. </p>
